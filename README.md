# Sales & Demand Forecasting using Machine Learning

This repository presents an **end-to-end sales and demand forecasting system** built using historical retail data. The project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be applied to time-series data to generate **reliable future sales forecasts** and support **data-driven business planning**.

---

## Project Overview

Sales forecasting plays a crucial role in modern businesses, enabling informed decisions around inventory management, staffing, cash flow planning, and risk reduction related to overstocking or demand shortages.

In this project, a machine learning–based forecasting pipeline is developed to **predict total sales for the next 30 days** using historical sales patterns and engineered time-based features. Beyond predictive accuracy, the project emphasizes **interpretability and practical usability**, ensuring that forecasts can be easily understood and applied by non-technical stakeholders.

## Dataset

The project uses the **Store Sales – Time Series Forecasting** dataset from Kaggle. Historical daily sales data from the `train.csv` file serves as the primary data source. The dataset includes sales figures across multiple product families along with promotion indicators.

While additional auxiliary datasets (such as holidays, oil prices, and store metadata) were available, they were intentionally excluded. This design choice helps keep the solution **focused, interpretable, and well-aligned with the scope of an introductory machine learning task**.

## Methodology

The forecasting pipeline follows a structured and systematic approach. Initially, historical sales data is cleaned, aggregated, and ordered chronologically. Missing values introduced during feature creation are handled carefully to preserve data integrity.

Time-based feature engineering is then applied to capture trends and seasonality. These features include calendar variables such as year, month, day, weekday, and week of year, along with lag features and rolling averages that represent recent sales behavior.

Two machine learning models are trained and evaluated. A **Linear Regression** model serves as a baseline for interpretability, while a **Random Forest Regressor** is used to capture non-linear demand patterns and interactions. Model performance is assessed using **MAE and RMSE**, with a time-aware train–test split to prevent data leakage.

To generate future predictions, **recursive forecasting** is implemented. In this approach, predicted values are iteratively fed back into lag and rolling features, enabling realistic multi-step forecasts for the next 30 days.

## Results and Visualizations

The final output of the system is a **30-day sales forecast** that preserves recent trends and weekly seasonality observed in historical data. Results are visualized using a focused forecast window that combines the **last 90 days of actual sales** with the **next 30 days of predicted sales**, allowing for clear comparison and interpretation.

## Key Learnings and Challenges

This project provided several important technical insights, including:
- Proper handling of time-series data using **time-aware train–test splits**
- The impact of **lag and rolling features** on forecasting performance
- Implementation of **recursive forecasting** for multi-step prediction
- Resolving challenges related to **forecast scaling and aggregation** to ensure alignment with real business metrics

The project also reinforces best practices in reproducibility by maintaining a lightweight notebook and clearing large outputs before committing to the repository.

## Business Use Case

The forecasts generated by this system can be used by businesses to:
- Plan inventory levels with greater confidence
- Optimize staffing schedules based on expected demand
- Support short-term financial and operational planning
- Establish a reliable baseline forecast for decision-making

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be effectively applied to **real-world sales forecasting problems** by combining time-based feature engineering, robust model evaluation, and business-focused interpretation. It serves as a strong foundational example of using machine learning to support practical, data-driven decision-making.
